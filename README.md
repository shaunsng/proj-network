# Project - Network Research

## Objective

Summary - Part one of this project entails preparing a script with multiple stages:
- To check for and install required applications such as sshpass and nipe. 
- To make an anonymous connection via nipe. 
- To ask the user for a domain or IP address for scanning. Namely, the target or victim. 
- To access a remote server and scan the provided domain/IP from that location, and to log the results. 
- Lastly, to retrieve the log to the local machine. 

Aim - This project simulates the initial phase of vulnerability assessment (blue team) or penetration testing/cyber attack (red team). Anonymising the user’s location twice over by Nipe/tor and by scanning the victim/target from a remote server underscores the importance of stealth and how actual attacker’s would use similar approaches when carrying out such reconnaissance activity. This project required students to have fundamental knowledge of networking, and also further develops/tests our scripting competencies. 

### Skills Learned

- The process of staging an "attack/scan" via a remote server
- Retrieving target data to local machine

### Tools Used
